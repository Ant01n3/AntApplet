Ant Applet
==========

A very simple program that tries to demonstrate how ants find the shortest path between a nest and one (or more) food sources.

The program uses Scala and the actor model to represent the ants. It uses GraphStream to represent an environment actor (a graph representing the possible paths for the ants). Then each ant is an actor that takes decision each time it encounters an intersection based on informations stored on the edges.

To get it:

    git clone https://github.com/Ant01n3/AntApplet.git

(The up to date repository link is on the right on the GitHub page (HTTPS clone URL)).

To use it, install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html), and launch it in the directory of this project (there are DEB, RPM, Gentoo packages as well as Homebrew and Macports packages). SBT will take care of all dependencies.

In the SBT console, to compile the project:

    compile

To run it:

    run

To package it as a standalone jar:

    proguard

You then can find the jar in ``target/scala-2.10/antsapplet_2.10-0.1.min.jar`` or something similar.
